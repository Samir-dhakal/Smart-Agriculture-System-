## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Agriculture System** is an AI-powered crop recommendation application that helps farmers make data-driven decisions by analyzing real-time **weather conditions** and **soil parameters**. Instead of relying on guesswork or tradition, farmers can input their soil data and location to receive an instant, accurate crop recommendation powered by Machine Learning.

> *"When farmers grow smarter, the nation grows stronger — and AI is the bridge that gets us there."*

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

> Farmers across India lack an intelligent and accessible system that recommends the most suitable crop based on real-time weather conditions and soil parameters — resulting in poor crop yield, excessive resource wastage, and severe economic loss for farming communities.

### Key Problems Identified:
| Problem | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ❌ Wrong Crop Selection | Farmers plant crops based on habit rather than soil suitability |
| 🌦️ Unpredictable Weather | Climate change disrupts traditional seasonal farming knowledge |
| 🧪 Poor Soil Management | Unknown N, P, K, pH levels cause fertilizer waste and soil damage |
| 📵 No Smart Tools | Rural farmers have zero access to AI-based advisory systems |

---

## 🎯 Objectives

**Objective 1 — Data Foundation**
> Collect and preprocess real-world weather data (temperature, humidity, rainfall) and soil data (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH) to build a clean, reliable, and balanced training dataset.

**Objective 2 — AI Model Development**
> Train and evaluate a supervised ML classification model using Random Forest that accurately recommends the best-suited crop with a target accuracy above 95%.

**Objective 3 — Accessible Deployment**
> Build a simple, user-friendly web interface where farmers can enter soil readings, auto-fetch live weather data by city name, and receive an instant crop recommendation with confidence score.
